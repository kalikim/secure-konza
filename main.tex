\section{Governance and Leadership}
Governance and leadership are foundational elements of a cybersecurity framework for smart cities. They involve establishing a Cybersecurity Task Force or Committee and appointing a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) responsible for overseeing cybersecurity efforts\cite{riskoptics-2022}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-cybersecurity-governance-no-date}\cite{atkinson-2021}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Establish a Cybersecurity Task Force or Committee:} This involves forming a group consisting of city officials, cybersecurity experts, and stakeholders\cite{riskoptics-2022}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-cybersecurity-governance-no-date}\cite{atkinson-2021}. The task force or committee is responsible for developing and implementing the city’s cybersecurity strategy, coordinating efforts across different departments and organizations, and ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned in their approach to cybersecurity123. In Kenya, the government established the National Kenya Computer Incident Response Team – Coordination Centre (National KE-CIRT/CC), which is a multi-agency collaboration framework that coordinates response to cyber security matters at the national level in collaboration with relevant actors locally and internationally\cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}.
    \item \textbf{Appoint a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):} The CISO is a senior-level executive responsible for developing and implementing the city’s cybersecurity strategy\cite{riskoptics-2022}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-cybersecurity-governance-no-date}\cite{atkinson-2021}. The CISO oversees all aspects of information security, including risk management, incident response, compliance, and training\cite{riskoptics-2022}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-cybersecurity-governance-no-date}\cite{atkinson-2021}. They also serve as the primary point of contact for all cybersecurity-related matters within the city\cite{riskoptics-2022}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-cybersecurity-governance-no-date}\cite{atkinson-2021}.



\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, by establishing strong governance structures and leadership roles, cities can ensure that their cybersecurity efforts are coordinated, strategic, and effective\cite{riskoptics-2022}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-cybersecurity-governance-no-date}\cite{atkinson-2021}.

\section{Risk Management}
Risk management is a critical component of a cybersecurity framework for smart cities. It involves conducting a comprehensive risk assessment to identify and prioritize cybersecurity risks specific to the city, and developing a risk mitigation plan with clear strategies for addressing high-priority risks\cite{nakar-2022}\cite{ibm-cyber-risk-management-no-date}\cite{securityscorecard-2023}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Conduct a Comprehensive Risk Assessment:} Risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating potential risks\cite{nakar-2022}\cite{ibm-cyber-risk-management-no-date}\cite{securityscorecard-2023}. This involves identifying the assets that could be affected by a cyber attack (such as data, systems, and networks), determining the threats to those assets, assessing the vulnerability of each asset to those threats, and evaluating the potential impact of each threat\cite{nakar-2022}\cite{ibm-cyber-risk-management-no-date}\cite{securityscorecard-2023}. In Kenya, the government launched the National Cybersecurity Strategy on 5th August 2022 as a roadmap to address new challenges and emerging threats in the cyber domain\cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}.
    \item \textbf{Develop a Risk Mitigation Plan:}  Once the risks have been identified and prioritized, the next step is to develop a risk mitigation plan\cite{nakar-2022}\cite{ibm-cyber-risk-management-no-date}\cite{securityscorecard-2023}. This involves determining the appropriate strategies for addressing each risk, such as implementing security controls, transferring the risk (for example, through insurance), avoiding the risk (for example, by not providing a particular service), or accepting the risk (if it is deemed to be low enough)\cite{nakar-2022}\cite{ibm-cyber-risk-management-no-date}\cite{securityscorecard-2023}. The plan should also include procedures for monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the risk mitigation strategies\cite{nakar-2022}\cite{ibm-cyber-risk-management-no-date}\cite{securityscorecard-2023}.



\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, by conducting comprehensive risk assessments and developing robust risk mitigation plans, cities can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture\cite{nakar-2022}\cite{ibm-cyber-risk-management-no-date}\cite{securityscorecard-2023}.

\section{Policies and Procedures}
Policies and procedures form the backbone of an organization’s cybersecurity posture. They provide clear guidelines for how to handle various cybersecurity scenarios and ensure that all employees understand their roles and responsibilities in maintaining cybersecurity\cite{united-states-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2023}\cite{pandey-2019}\cite{shacklett-2019}.
Let’s delve into the details of each of these areas:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Data Protection Policies:} These policies define how an organization protects its data from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction\cite{united-states-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2023}. They are crucial because they help organizations understand information security and applications. Moreover, they explain the responsibilities of every stakeholder in the company towards protecting systems\cite{pandey-2019}. Globally recognized standards for data protection include ISO/IEC 27001\cite{shacklett-2019} and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework\cite{the-center-for-internet-security-inc-no-date}.

    \item \textbf{Access Control Policies:} These policies establish the standards for user access, network access controls, and system software controls\cite{securityscorecard-2023}. They are essential in ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive data and systems\cite{microsoft-no-date}. Internationally, access control is a key component of standards like ISO/IEC 27001\cite{shacklett-2019} and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework\cite{the-center-for-internet-security-inc-no-date}.
    \item \textbf{Incident Response Policies:} These policies outline an organization’s processes for detecting and responding to security incidents\cite{united-states-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2023}. They are vital for managing cyber threats proactively and minimizing the impact of any security breaches that occur. Globally recognized standards for incident response include ISO/IEC 27001\cite{shacklett-2019} and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework\cite{the-center-for-internet-security-inc-no-date}.

Internationally, employee training is a key component of standards like ISO/IEC 27001\cite{shacklett-2019} and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework\cite{the-center-for-internet-security-inc-no-date}.


\end{enumerate}
In Kenya, cybersecurity policies and procedures are guided by various laws such as the National Information Communications and Technology (ICT) Policy Guidelines, 2020, the Kenya Information and Communications Act (KICA), and the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018 (CMCA)\cite{mitullah-shako-associates-2022}. The government also launched the National Cybersecurity Strategy in 2022 to address new challenges and emerging threats in the cyber domain\cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}.

In conclusion, well-defined policies and procedures are crucial for maintaining a secure digital environment in smart cities.

\section{Infrastructure Security}
Infrastructure security is a critical aspect of cybersecurity that focuses on protecting the infrastructure services essential to a company’s survival and success. It involves implementing robust security measures to safeguard the physical and software systems that constitute an organization’s IT infrastructure\cite{watts-2023}.

In the context of cybersecurity, infrastructure security includes several components:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Network Security:} This involves implementing measures to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data in a network. It includes measures such as installing firewalls to block or allow traffic, intrusion detection \& prevention systems to detect network intrusions, and using Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to protect data transmitted over the network\cite{trend-micro-network-security-measures-no-date}.
    \item \textbf{Software and Firmware Updates:} Regularly updating and patching software and firmware is crucial for maintaining the security of IT infrastructure. These updates often contain fixes for known security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. Enabling automatic updates, avoiding obsolete software, visiting vendor sites directly for updates, and performing updates on trusted networks are some best practices for software and firmware updates\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-patches-and-software-updates-2023}\cite{watchguard-technologies-vulnerabilities-exploited-2023}.
    \item \textbf{IoT Security:} With the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, securing these devices has become a significant part of infrastructure security. IoT devices often lack built-in security, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. Therefore, it’s crucial to implement security measures that protect these devices and the networks they connect to from cyber threats\cite{fortinet-no-date}\cite{praveen-2023}.
\end{enumerate}

In Kenya, the government launched the National Cybersecurity Strategy in 2022 as a roadmap to address new challenges and emerging threats in the cyber domain\cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}. The strategy emphasizes the importance of strong policy, legal and regulatory frameworks, protection of critical information infrastructure, cultivating a skilled cybersecurity workforce, minimizing crimes and incidents, and fostering cooperation and collaboration\cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}.

Globally, organizations like the World Economic Forum have highlighted the importance of securing critical infrastructure to keep services running in the event of a cyberattack\cite{world-economic-forum-securing-critical-infrastructure-2023}. The Global Cybersecurity Outlook report identifies trends and analyzes future cybersecurity challenges, emphasizing the need for robust infrastructure security measures\cite{world-economic-forum-global-cybersecurity-outlook-2023}.

In conclusion, infrastructure security is a vital component of an organization’s overall cybersecurity strategy. It requires continuous monitoring, assessments, mitigation across various interrelated components including servers, cloud resources, IoT devices, internet connections, and physical assets used to access networks\cite{securing-networks-cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-cisa-no-date}.

\section{Data security}
Data security is a critical aspect of a cybersecurity framework for smart cities. It involves implementing robust measures to protect sensitive data and ensure its availability\cite{otoole-2023}\cite{joshi-2021}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Implement Encryption and Access Controls:} Encryption is a method of scrambling data so that it’s useless and unreadable, except for those with an encryption key that can decipher it34\cite{amthul-2019}\cite{appleton-2022}. It ensures breached data is unreadable and useless to those who might steal it\cite{amthul-2019}. Access controls, on the other hand, are security measures that identify users and control their access to resources or systems\cite{amthul-2019}. They help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data\cite{amthul-2019}.
    \item \textbf{Establish Data Backup and Recovery Mechanisms:} Data backup and recovery are essential practices in data security\cite{isaca-db-backup-2012}\cite{convocar-2023}\cite{flynn-2021}. They involve creating copies of data that can be used to restore the original after a data loss event\cite{isaca-db-backup-2012}\cite{convocar-2023}\cite{flynn-2021}. Regular testing of backup and recovery measures is also crucial to ensure they work as expected\cite{isaca-db-backup-2012}\cite{convocar-2023}\cite{flynn-2021}.
    \item \textbf{Regular Audits:} Regular audits help ensure that the implemented security measures are working as intended and that the data remains secure\cite{isaca-db-backup-2012}. They can identify potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement\cite{isaca-db-backup-2012}.
    \item \textbf{User Access Logging:} User access logging connects to SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, so system administrators can identify unusual access that indicates a potential attack\cite{amthul-2019}.
    \item \textbf{Encryption Key Management:} Encryption key management ensures the ongoing security of the system\cite{amthul-2019}. It involves the administration of tasks involved in encryption such as key generation, exchange, storage, use, and replacement\cite{amthul-2019}.
\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, by implementing robust encryption and access controls, establishing effective data backup and recovery mechanisms, conducting regular audits, managing encryption keys effectively, and logging user access, cities can significantly enhance their data security posture.

\section{Incident Response and Recovery}

This involves the development of a detailed incident response plan to address cybersecurity incidents promptly and the establishment of a cyber incident reporting mechanism for residents and businesses.


In the context of Kenya, the government has established the National Kenya Computer Incident Response Team – Coordination Centre (National KE-CIRT/CC). This is a multi-agency collaboration framework responsible for national coordination of cybersecurity\cite{communications-authority-of-kenya-incidents-no-date}. The National KE-CIRT/CC detects, prevents, and responds to various cyber threats targeted at the country\cite{communications-authority-of-kenya-incidents-no-date}. They also facilitate contact and collaboration with affected organizations to investigate, respond to, and resolve cyber incidents\cite{communications-authority-of-kenya-incidents-no-date}.


On a global scale, incident response refers to an organization’s processes and technologies for detecting and responding to cyber threats, security breaches, or cyberattacks\cite{ibm-incidents-response-no-date}. An effective incident response plan can help cybersecurity teams detect and contain cyber threats, restore affected systems faster, and reduce the lost revenue, regulatory fines, and other costs associated with these threats\cite{ibm-incidents-response-no-date}.


In both cases, the goal is to prevent cyberattacks before they happen, minimize the cost and business disruption resulting from any cyberattacks that occur, and ensure a quick recovery from such incidents. This is achieved by having clear procedures in place for identifying, containing, and resolving different types of cyberattacks\cite{ibm-incidents-response-no-date}.

\section{IoT Device Security}
IoT device security is a critical aspect of a cybersecurity framework for smart cities. It involves enforcing security standards for IoT device manufacturers and suppliers, and implementing network segmentation to isolate IoT devices from critical systems\cite{australian-cybersecurity-center-2020}\cite{unknown-author-2023}\cite{fernandez-2020}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Enforce Security Standards for IoT Device Manufacturers and Suppliers:} Security standards provide a set of guidelines and specifications that manufacturers must follow when designing and building IoT devices\cite{australian-cybersecurity-center-2020}\cite{unknown-author-2023}.

\section{Compliance and Regulations}
Compliance and regulations in cybersecurity refer to the adherence to certain standards, laws, and guidelines that aim to ensure the security of information systems and data. These regulations are often set by government bodies, industry groups, or organizations themselves and are designed to protect against cyber threats \cite{comptia-no-date}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item In Kenya, the regulatory framework for cybersecurity includes the Computer Misuse and Cybercrimes Act, 2018\cite{east-africa-hi-tech-solutions-laws-regulations-2023}. This law is designed to protect citizens and organizations from online threats such as hacking, fraud, and data breaches\cite{east-africa-hi-tech-solutions-laws-regulations-2023}. Additionally, the Data Protection Act No. 24 of 2019 regulates data protection in Kenya\cite{macoduol-2022}. The Act came into effect on 25 November 2019, followed by several regulations on 31 December 2021\cite{macoduol-2022}.
    \item On a global scale, there is a growing call for the harmonization of cybersecurity regulations. This could reduce compliance cost and complexity for companies and consumers\cite{world-economic-forum-2023}. The three major areas that would benefit from industry-wide harmonization of cybersecurity regulations are data protection, interoperability, and cost\cite{world-economic-forum-2023}.
    \item Regular auditing is a crucial part of ensuring compliance with these regulations. Audits help organizations assess their compliance with legal and industry regulations, identify vulnerabilities across digital infrastructures, stay ahead of cyber criminals, avoid fines, evaluate overall data security, determine whether software and hardware work as they should, discover unknown vulnerabilities, uncover inefficiencies in software or hardware, determine the adequacy of existing policies and training, and gauge employee compliance or threats\cite{miller-2023}.
    



\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, compliance with cybersecurity regulations is not just about meeting legal requirements; it’s about creating a secure environment for data and systems. By regularly auditing their cybersecurity practices and making necessary adjustments, organizations can ensure they are doing their part to protect against cyber threats.

In Kenya, the government established the National Kenya Computer Incident Response Team – Coordination Centre (National KE-CIRT/CC), a multi-agency collaboration framework which is responsible for the national coordination of cyber security\cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}. This collaboration framework coordinates response to cyber security matters at the national level in collaboration with relevant actors locally and internationally\cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}.
\item \textbf{Collaborate with Cybersecurity Organizations: }Cybersecurity organizations can provide expertise, threat intelligence, and resources that can help cities enhance their cybersecurity posture\cite{wall-2022}\cite{bcs-the-chartered-institute-for-it-2021}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2021}. These organizations often have deep knowledge of the latest cyber threats and effective mitigation strategies\cite{wall-2022}\cite{bcs-the-chartered-institute-for-it-2021}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2021}.
\item \textbf{Collaborate with Industry Partners:} Industry partners can provide valuable resources such as advanced security technologies, threat intelligence, and expertise\cite{wall-2022}\cite{bcs-the-chartered-institute-for-it-2021}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2021}. They can also provide insights into emerging trends and technologies that could impact a city’s cybersecurity posture\cite{wall-2022}\cite{bcs-the-chartered-institute-for-it-2021}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2021}.

\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, by collaborating with government agencies, cybersecurity organizations, and industry partners to share threat intelligence and resources, cities can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture\cite{wall-2022}\cite{bcs-the-chartered-institute-for-it-2021}\cite{cybersecurity-and-infrastructure-security-agency-2021}.


\section{Reporting and Accountability}
Reporting and accountability are crucial aspects of a cybersecurity framework for smart cities. They involve establishing mechanisms for reporting cybersecurity incidents and breaches, and holding individuals and organizations accountable for breaches due to negligence \cite{singh-2023}\cite{kost-2023}\cite{chin-2023}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
\item \textbf{Establish Mechanisms for Reporting Cybersecurity Incidents and Breaches: }This involves creating a system or process for individuals and organizations to report cybersecurity incidents and breaches \cite{singh-2023}\cite{kost-2023}\cite{chin-2023}. Such a system can help to ensure that incidents are reported in a timely manner, which can be critical for limiting the damage caused by a cyber attack \cite{singh-2023}\cite{kost-2023}\cite{chin-2023}. In Kenya, any person who operates a computer system or network whether private or public has an obligation to immediately report to the National KE-CIRT/CC any attacks, intrusions, and other disruptions to the functioning of the computer system within 24 hours \cite{ashitiva-2022}.
\item \textbf{Hold Individuals and Organizations Accountable for Breaches Due to Negligence:}  This involves implementing policies and procedures that hold individuals and organizations accountable for breaches that occur due to their negligence \cite{singh-2023}\cite{kost-2023}\cite{chin-2023}. This can include disciplinary actions, fines, or other penalties\cite{singh-2023}\cite{kost-2023}\cite{chin-2023}. Accountability in cybersecurity means that every individual and organization involved in an information system should have specific and measurable responsibilities for preventing, mitigating, and communicating cybersecurity incidents \cite{singh-2023}.


\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, by establishing mechanisms for reporting cybersecurity incidents and breaches, and holding individuals and organizations accountable for breaches due to negligence, cities can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture\cite{singh-2023}\cite{kost-2023}\cite{chin-2023}.


\section{Budget and Resource Allocation}
Budget and resource allocation are crucial aspects of a cybersecurity framework for smart cities. They involve allocating sufficient resources, both financial and human, to support the cybersecurity framework’s implementation and maintenance \cite{opurum-2022}\cite{roohparvar-2023}\cite{leidwinger-no-date}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]

    \item \textbf{Allocate Sufficient Financial Resources:} Allocating a budget for cybersecurity is a critical step. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach, a common guideline is to dedicate a percentage of your overall budget to cybersecurity, often around 10-15\%\cite{roohparvar-2023}. This allocation will provide you with the financial foundation to execute your cybersecurity strategy effectively\cite{roohparvar-2023}. In Kenya, the ICT sector has been allocated Ksh15.6 billion \cite{muli-2022}. On a global scale, cybersecurity spending in the coming year may not be recession-proof, but it’s likely to be recession-resistant\cite{mello-2022}. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that this year’s \$262.4 billion in expenditures will grow to \$458.9 billion in 2025\cite{freeze-2021}.
    
    \item \textbf{Allocate Sufficient Human Resources:} Human resources are equally important in supporting the cybersecurity framework’s implementation and maintenance \cite{opurum-2022}\cite{roohparvar-2023}\cite{leidwinger-no-date}. This involves not only hiring skilled cybersecurity professionals but also training existing staff to handle cybersecurity tasks \cite{opurum-2022}\cite{roohparvar-2023}\cite{leidwinger-no-date}. In Kenya, the government launched the National Cybersecurity Strategy on 5th August 2022 as a roadmap to address new challenges and emerging threats in the cyber domain \cite{national-computer-and-cybercrimes-coordination-committee-no-date}.

\end{enumerate}
In conclusion, by allocating sufficient resources, both financial and human, to support the cybersecurity framework’s implementation and maintenance, cities can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture\cite{opurum-2022}\cite{roohparvar-2023}\cite{leidwinger-no-date}.


\section{Review and Audit}
Review and audit are crucial aspects of a cybersecurity framework for smart cities. They involve conducting regular reviews and cybersecurity audits to identify weaknesses and areas for improvement \cite{riskoptics-2023} \cite{chimwanda-2022} \cite{miller-2023}.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Conduct Regular Reviews:}  Regular reviews involve assessing the current state of the city’s cybersecurity posture, identifying any changes in the threat landscape, and evaluating the effectiveness of existing security controls\cite{riskoptics-2023} \cite{chimwanda-2022} \cite{miller-2023}. These reviews can help to identify any gaps in the city’s cybersecurity defenses and provide insights into areas where improvements can be made\cite{riskoptics-2023} \cite{chimwanda-2022} \cite{miller-2023}. In Kenya, the government established the National Kenya Computer Incident Response Team – Coordination Centre (National KE-CIRT/CC), a multi-agency collaboration framework that coordinates response to cybersecurity matters at the national level in collaboration with relevant actors locally and internationally \cite{the-national-kecirtcc-2022}.
    \item \textbf{Conduct Cybersecurity Audits:}  Cybersecurity audits are a more formal process that involves a comprehensive assessment of an organization’s cybersecurity practices\cite{riskoptics-2023} \cite{chimwanda-2022} \cite{miller-2023}. The audit can help to understand how well your technologies, policies, and people work together to reduce risks from cyberattacks \cite{riskoptics-2023}. It should uncover all of an organization’s cybersecurity risks and detail the policies, procedures, and controls in place to manage these risks effectively \cite{riskoptics-2023}. In Kenya, cybersecurity audits have become increasingly important due to the rapidly growing use of technology and the internet \cite{east-africa-hi-tech-solutions-2023}.
\end{enumerate}



In conclusion, by conducting regular reviews and cybersecurity audits, cities can significantly enhance their cybersecurity posture\cite{riskoptics-2023} \cite{chimwanda-2022} \cite{miller-2023}.
